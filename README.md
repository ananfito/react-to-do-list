## Overivew
This app offers the ability to add items to a ToDo list with features like checking items 'completed' and the option to delete items. The list is stored in `localStorage` so the data persists even when the page is refreshed.

## My Process
For this project, I followed the instructions outlined in the tutorial video linked above. I started by creating the app within a single file, App.jsx, to ensure full functionality before breaking it into different components and place them in their own files (e.g., TodoItem.jsx, TodoList.jsx). 

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
